# TV_Script_Generation
RNN Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

# Project Overview

In this project, I have generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I have used part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network that I have build generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.


# Accelerating the training Process

If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen RNN architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU. If you'd like to use a GPU, you can spin up an instance of your own:

### Amazon Web Services
You can use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money)

### Google Colab
You can run this notebook in Google Colab for free. You have to be careful about the access of the extracted data in the notebook.
